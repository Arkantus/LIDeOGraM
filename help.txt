HERE IS A LITTLE TUTORIAL ABOUT THE UTILISATION OF LSN !

I) General Utilisation:
I-1) Graphical model

The nodes represent all the multi-scales parameters of the experiment, the more
we go down, the more the scale of the parameter is small.
The edges between the nodes represent the links between  them. Those edges are directed,
their thicker parts are their end and there are only the starting nodes that depend of the ending nodes,
not the reverse.

I-2) Equations list

To show the equations of a node, click on it in the graphical model, the selected node is red.
In the list there are 3 columns :
 * "Complexity", that shows the level of complexity of each equation, the more the level is high the more the equation is complex.
* "Fitness", that shows the level of adequation between the Equation's solutions and the Experimental values, a low fitness means the equation
give results close to reality.
* "Equation", that shows all the equations corresponding tothe select node.

I-3) Mesured VS Predicted plot

To show this graphic, click on an equation in the list.
The red points correspond to the Local Model's solutions.
When a red point is close to the red line, the corresponding solution is close to the reality.
When a lot of red points are fare from the red line, it means the Local Model make a bad prediction.

II) Additional functions:
II-1) Global Model:

- Click on the button " Show Global Model" to turn on the option.
- Click on an equation in the list.

The blue points correspond to the Global Model's solutions.

- Click on the button " Hide Global Model" to turn off the option.
- Click on an equation to refresh the "Mesured VS Predicted Plot"'s graphic.

II-2) Remove Link:
A) Remove the link

- Click on the button "Remove Link" to turn on the option.
- Select the first node to constrain, like indicate by the text "Selct node 1".
- Select the second node to constrain, like indicate by the text "Select node 2".

B) Reinstate the link

- Select the removed link in the scrolled list "Select link to reinstate".
- Click on the button "Reinstate" to reinstate the link.
